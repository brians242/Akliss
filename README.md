# Akliss

A bot that aims to use take a video and send images back with OpenCV and basic commands (By forking the project and changing the video files).

First public version of a bot made by me.

## Instructions:

1. The starting prefix is ;, and make sure to use ;help to see your options.
2. There are placeholders for the images folder and the video, make sure to delete those.
3. For the frame command, make sure to replace the framemaker.py file with your directory the project is in, followed by your video name, and do that in the main.py file as well with the frame command.
